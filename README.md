# Data Analyst Agent using Hundreds of Datasets on Amazon Athena

This guidance presents an approach to run a Data Analyst Agent targeting hundreds of datasets hosted on Amazon Athena. The Agent discovers the datasets relevant to a given query using a semantic search on Amazon S3 Vectors.

## Overview

1. Provide a brief overview explaining the what, why, or how of your Guidance. You can answer any one of the following to help you write this:

    - **Why did you build this Guidance?**
    - **What problem does this Guidance solve?**

2. Include the architecture diagram image, as well as the steps explaining the high-level overview and flow of the architecture. 
    - To add a screenshot, create an ‘assets/images’ folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README. 

### Architecture

### Cost

This section is for a high-level cost estimate. Think of a likely straightforward scenario with reasonable assumptions based on the problem the Guidance is trying to solve. Provide an in-depth cost breakdown table in this section below ( you should use AWS Pricing Calculator to generate cost breakdown ).

Start this section with the following boilerplate text:

_You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Guidance. As of <month> <year>, the cost for running this Guidance with the default settings in the <Default AWS Region (Most likely will be US East (N. Virginia)) > is approximately $<n.nn> per month for processing ( <nnnnn> records )._

Replace this amount with the approximate cost for running your Guidance in the default Region. This estimate should be per month and for processing/serving resonable number of requests/entities.

Suggest you keep this boilerplate text:
_We recommend creating a [Budget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html) through [AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) to help manage costs. Prices are subject to change. For full details, refer to the pricing webpage for each AWS service used in this Guidance._

### Sample Cost Table

**Note : Once you have created a sample cost table using AWS Pricing Calculator, copy the cost breakdown to below table and upload a PDF of the cost estimation on BuilderSpace. Do not add the link to the pricing calculator in the ReadMe.**

The following table provides a sample cost breakdown for deploying this Guidance with the default parameters in the US East (N. Virginia) Region for one month.

| AWS service  | Dimensions | Cost [USD] |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Amazon API Gateway | 1,000,000 REST API calls per month  | $ 3.50month |
| Amazon Cognito | 1,000 active users per month without advanced security feature | $ 0.00 |

## Prerequisites

### Operating System

- Talk about the base Operating System (OS) and environment that can be used to run or deploy this Guidance, such as *Mac, Linux, or Windows*. Include all installable packages or modules required for the deployment. 
- By default, assume Amazon Linux 2/Amazon Linux 2023 AMI as the base environment. All packages that are not available by default in AMI must be listed out.  Include the specific version number of the package or module.

**Example:**
“These deployment instructions are optimized to best work on **<Amazon Linux 2 AMI>**.  Deployment in another OS may require additional steps.”

- Include install commands for packages, if applicable.

### aws cdk bootstrap

<If using aws-cdk, include steps for account bootstrap for new cdk users.>

**Example blurb:** “This Guidance uses aws-cdk. If you are using aws-cdk for first time, please perform the below bootstrapping....”

## Deployment Steps (required)

Deployment steps must be numbered, comprehensive, and usable to customers at any level of AWS expertise. The steps must include the precise commands to run, and describe the action it performs.

* All steps must be numbered.
* If the step requires manual actions from the AWS console, include a screenshot if possible.
* The steps must start with the following command to clone the repo. ```git clone xxxxxxx```
* If applicable, provide instructions to create the Python virtual environment, and installing the packages using ```requirement.txt```.
* If applicable, provide instructions to capture the deployed resource ARN or ID using the CLI command (recommended), or console action.

 
**Example:**

1. Clone the repo using command ```git clone xxxxxxxxxx```
2. cd to the repo folder ```cd <repo-name>```
3. Install packages in requirements using command ```pip install requirement.txt```
4. Edit content of **file-name** and replace **s3-bucket** with the bucket name in your account.
5. Run this command to deploy the stack ```cdk deploy``` 
6. Capture the domain name created by running this CLI command ```aws apigateway ............```



## Deployment Validation  (required)

<Provide steps to validate a successful deployment, such as terminal output, verifying that the resource is created, status of the CloudFormation template, etc.>


**Examples:**

* Open CloudFormation console and verify the status of the template with the name starting with xxxxxx.
* If deployment is successful, you should see an active database instance with the name starting with <xxxxx> in        the RDS console.
*  Run the following CLI command to validate the deployment: ```aws cloudformation describe xxxxxxxxxxxxx```



## Running the Guidance

<Provide instructions to run the Guidance with the sample data or input provided, and interpret the output received.> 

This section should include:

* Guidance inputs
* Commands to run
* Expected output (provide screenshot if possible)
* Output description

## Next Steps
The system can work with any other dataset, simply upload its parquet data file, and the JSON metadata file to the correspondent S3 buckets.

## Cleanup
To delete the CDK stacks:
```
cdk destroy --all
```
